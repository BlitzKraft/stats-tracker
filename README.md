Stats-Tracker is a utility to keep track of a certain variable over time. I made this
with the goal of tracking my weight, as I'm working on losing some.

## Goals:

[ ] Track values over time (for example, weight tracking)
[ ] Have multiple trackers (such as one for weight, one for stocks etc)
[ ] Automatically add timestamp to the logged value
[ ] Display a bar/line chart (ascii) - with an option to consolidate the data daily
[ ] Serve the graphs over html (?)
